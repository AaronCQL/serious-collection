## Setup

This repository contains personal notes/cheatsheets made using Markdown and/or LaTeX. Each directory contains the PDF, as well as the assets used and the source code (`.md`/`.tex`) that generated the PDF.

- **Markdown**: relies on [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) support. To view the above `.md` files directly in Github with properly rendered math equations, use Chrome with this [Mathjax Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima?hl=en) (otherwise, PDF copies are also available in the respective directories). PDF files are generated using [Typora](https://www.typora.io/)

- **LaTeX**: PDF files are generated with `latexmk -pdf` command
